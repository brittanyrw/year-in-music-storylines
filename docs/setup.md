# Setup for Workshop
If you would like to follow along with us during the workshop, please set up the following:

### Create a Contentful account at [https://www.contentful.com/](https://www.contentful.com/). 
* For new accounts during the new user onboarding if you see an option for starter templates, choose 'Start from Scratch'. You do not have to complete the 'Learning Contentful' steps.
* If you already have a Contentful account and space, have at least one slot available for a new content type.

### For the code (frontend) of the project
* Create a CodeSandbox account at [https://codesandbox.io/](https://codesandbox.io/). We will use this to look at the code for the project. If you are new to coding, this is the best way to follow along. Highly suggest everyone to use CodeSandbox so we are on the same page.
* If you are comfortable with GitHub, the terminal, etc then feel free to just fork or download this repository. Your Node version needs to be at least 16.18.1.
